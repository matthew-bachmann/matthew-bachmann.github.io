<p> I am a mathematics graduate student at the University of
    Nebraska-Lincoln and am expected to earn my PhD in May 2024. My research
    interests are in applications of homological algebra and derived category methods to commutative
    algebra. My research advisor is Mark Walker.
</p>

<p>
  Besides pure math research, I have many other professional interests. I am passionate about mathematical
  mentorship and outreach. Currently, I am part of the organizing
  committee for the Upcoming Researchers in
  Commutative Algebra (URiCA) conference. I also helped found the Directed Reading Program (DRP) at UNL with my friend <a href="https://www.math.unl.edu/~aeide2/">Austin Eide</a>.
  Additionally, I like to
  discuss mathematics education and am always striving to be a better
  teacher (in the classroom and out). I'm also eager to learn more about html/css and programming. Though they aren't much, I've had a lot of fun learning about how to design my website and the websites listed in the top right.
  If you're interested in any of
  these things and want to chat, please reach out!
