  I am a Visiting Professor in Mathematics at Davidson College. My current interests are in probabilistic methods, stochastic processes, and machine leanrning applications in data science. I received my PhD in Mathematics from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in August 2023 advised by Mark Walker. My dissertation concerned applications of homological algebra and derived category methods in commutative algebra.

<h2>Current Interests</h2>

<p>
  This academic year I am teaching a statistics course with an emphasis on applications in R and data visualization (if you are a student please visit the course Moodle page). Course materials from the statistics course and my coding projects can be found at my <a href="https://https://github.com/matthew-bachmann/">GitHub</a>.  I've also enjoyed learning enough html/css to design this page though I hope to learn more web development soon. If you're interested in any of these things and want to chat, please reach out!
  </p>
  
  <p>
   I also enjoy watching movies, playing chess, playing Rocket League, reading (contemporary fiction and fantasy), and trying new restaurants. I recently moved to the Charlotte area after completing my degree in Lincoln, so I'm excited to explore the new area.
