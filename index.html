<p> I am a mathematics graduate student at the University of
    Nebraska-Lincoln and am expected to earn my PhD in May 2024. My research
    interests are in applications of homological algebra and derived category methods to commutative
    algebra. My research advisor is Mark Walker.
</p>

<p>
  Besides pure math research, I am passionate about mathematical
  mentorship and outreach. I currently am part of the organizing
  committee for the Upcoming Researchers in
  Commutative Algebra (URiCA) conference, Commutative Algebra Reading
  Seminar (CARS), and the
  Directed Reading Program (DRP), and the . I'm also eager to learn
  more about html/css and programming. Though it isn't much, I'm quite
  proud to say I designed this webpage. Additionally, I like to
  discuss mathematics education and am always striving to be a better
  teacher (in the classroom and out). If you're interested in any of
  these things and want to chat, please reach out!
