<p> I am an Adjunct Lecturer in Mathematics at Davidson College. My research
    interests are in applications of homological algebra and derived category methods to commutative
    algebra. I received my PhD in Mathematics from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln in August 2023 advised by Mark Walker.
</p>

<p>
  Besides pure math research, I have many other professional interests. I am currently iterested in projects with a data science flavor. This year I am teaching a statistics course with an emphasis on applications in R and data visualization. I am also currently working on building a nueral network from sctratch in order to learn more about ML algorithms and develop Python skills. You can see more about the statistics course projects and my attempt at building a nueral network on my <a href="https://https://github.com/matthew-bachmann/" style="float:right;">GitHub </a> .  I also enjoy picking up basic html/css skills in order to design my website (which is why it is quite plain but getting better!). 
  
  For fun I enjoy movies, playing chess, reading (contemporary fiction and fantasy), and trying new restaurants.
  If you're interested in any of these things and want to chat, please reach out!
