## Today's Agenda

-   Type Errors

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Decision Errors


| |$H_0$ is True | $H_0$ is False |
|:--|:--|:--|
|Do not reject $H_0$ | Correct conclusion | Type II error
|Reject $H_0$ | Type I error | Correct conclusion |

#### A snack-food company produces a 454-g bag of pretzels. Although the actual net weights deviate slightly from $454$ g and vary from one bag to another, the company insists that the mean net weight of the bags be $454$ g. As part of its program, the quality assurance department periodically performs a hypothesis test to decide whether the packaging machine is working properly, that is, to decide whether the mean net weight of all bags packaged is $454$ g.

$H_0: $

$H_A: $

Type I error:

Type II error: 

## Power 

#### **Example:** The manufacturer of a new model car claims that a typical car gets 26 miles per gallon (mpg). A consumer advocacy group is skeptical of this claim and thinks that the mean gas mileage, $\mu$, of may be less than 26 mpg. The group plans to perform the hypothesis test

$H_0: \mu = 26$ mpg

$H_A: \mu < 26$ mpg

#### at a $5 \%$ significance level using a sample of size 30. Find the probability of making a type II error is the true mean gas mileage is: 

#### $25$ mpg

#### $24.8$ mpg

1. Cadmium, a heavy metal, is toxic to animals. Mushrooms, however, are able to absorb and accumulate cadmium at high concentrations. The Czech and Slovak governments have set a safety limit for cadmium in dry vegetables at $0.5$ part per million (ppm). A hypothesis test is to be performed to decide whether the mean cadmium level in mushrooms is greater than the governmentâ€™s recommended limit. It is known that the population is normally distributed and has standard deviation $0.37$ ppm of cadmium. A sample of $12$ mushrooms has a mean cadmium level of $0.55$ ppm a significance level of $5 \%$. Does the data provide statistically significant evidence that the mean cadmium levels is higher than the goverment's recommend limit?

2. If the true average is $0.8$ ppm, what is the power of the test at detecting this?
