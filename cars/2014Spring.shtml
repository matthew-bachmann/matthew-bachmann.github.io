  <h3><em> Yoneda's Ext and the Yoneda Splice</em></h3>
 April 29
  <hr>
The modules Ext<em><sub>R</sub></em>(<em>M</em>,<em>N</em>) are typically defined by computing the cohomology of a complex formed using a projective resolution of <em>M</em> or an injective resolution of <em>N</em>. Yoneda provided an alternative description of Ext<em><sub>R</sub></em>(<em>M</em>,<em>N</em>) in terms of equivalence classes of exact sequences which avoids the use of projective and injective modules. We'll describe Yoneda's Ext and discuss it's equivalence with classical Ext. If time permits, we'll see how Yoneda's Ext gives a concrete description of the classical Yoneda pairing.

  <h3><em>The Frobenius Functor and Homological Dimensions - Part II </em></h3>
 April 22
  <hr>
For a local ring <em>R</em> of positive characteristic we can define the Frobenius endomorphism <em>f</em>: <em>R</em> &#x2192; <em>R</em> by <em>f</em>(<em>r</em>)=<em>r</em><em><sup>p</sup></em>. This map allows us to consider the ring as an algebra over itself in a non-trivial way. Such a construction was used by Peskine and Szpiro in their proof of the New Intersection Theorem and has led to many important results in homological algebra. We'll discuss the basics of the Frobenius functor of Peskine and Szpiro, including several examples, and, time permitting, present some recent applications.

  <h3><em>Cohen-Macaulay dimension for coherent rings</em></h3>
 April 8
  <hr>
When faced with a non-Noetherian ring, one
            has several options, including but not limited to
	    <ol>
		    <li>Weeping, because the idea
            of a non-Noetherian ring makes you highly uncomfortable</li>
		    <li>Trying to adapt some beloved concepts of Noetherian rings, in an effort to ease your discomfort</li>
	    </ol>
            <br>

            In this talk, we'll mainly focus on the latter.&nbsp; In
            particular, we'll define notion Cohen-Macaulay (CM)
            dimension for modules over non-Noetherian rings, based on
            work of A. Gerko in the Noetherian case. We can then define
            a quasi-local coherent ring to be CM if every finitely
            presented module has finite CM dimension. We will look at
            some properties of CM rings, compared to both the usual
            notion of Cohen-Macaulayness and to other generalizations to
            non-Noetherian rings.</li>

  <h3><em>The Homotopy Lie Algebra of a Local Ring - Part II </em></h3>
 March 18
  <hr>
I'll show the construction of the homotopy Lie algebra of a local ring, this is the plan: I'll start by talking about DG algebras and how to construct resolutions of the residue field that are DG algebras, in particular I'll talk about Tate resolutions and acyclic closures; I'll use acyclic closures to prove 2 theorems on the Poincare' series of a local ring. Then I'll move to derivations, I'll define what are the gamma derivations and give some properties; then I'll define what is a graded Lie algebra and I will use the derivations of the acyclic closure to define the homotopy Lie algebra of a local ring. At the end I will use the homotopy Lie algebra to prove a theorem of Martsinkovsky about bounded maps of resolutions of the residue field that has an application to stable cohomology.

  <h3><em> Affine Schemes - Part II</em></h3>
 March 4
  <hr>
Affine Schemes are the fundamental spaces in which geometry is done. In this talk, we will develop intuition and feel for affine schemes and how they relate to classical varieties through examples and appropriate hand waving. We will follow the treatment laid out in Chapter's 3 and 4 of Ravi Vakil's algebraic geometry notes. We start by looking at the underlying set of affine schemes, the Zariski topology and then structure sheaf of "functions" on the space. We will see why "functions" is written with quotes and conclude with the role of nilpotents in modern geometry by looking at some canonical examples.

  Let (<em>R</em>,&#x1D510;) be a <em>d</em>-dimensional complete local Gorenstein ring, with <em>E</em> the injective hull of <em>R</em>/&#x1D510;, and <em>M</em> any finitely generated R-module.

Applying these ideas, we will prove a variant of the Hartshorne-Lichtenbaum Vanishing Theorem (HLVT), an important result on the vanishing of local cohomology modules with support not &#x1D510;-primary.

  <hr>
  We will outline the basics of local cohomology (which will first require a brief treatment of derived functors).  As a first application of local cohomology, we will examine local duality: Let (<em>R</em>,&#x1D510;) be a <em>d</em>-dimensional complete local Gorenstein ring, with <em>E</em> the injective hull of <em>R</em>/&#x1D510;, and <em>M</em> any finitely generated R-module.

  <h3><em>Symmetry in the Vanishing of Ext Part - II</em></h3>
February 4
  <hr>
We'll continue the discussion of AB rings, defined by Huneke and Jorgensen, with the goal of showing that they, like complete intersections, exhibit a surprising symmetry in the vanishing of Ext. We'll also discuss whether AB rings live strictly between the classes of Gorenstein rings and complete intersection rings.

We'll explore classes of rings that exhibit a surprising symmetry in the vanishing of Ext. In Part 1, we'll discuss the motivating result of Avramov and Buchweitz over complete intersections, and build tools to understand the class Gorenstein of rings later defined by Huneke and Jorgensen.
