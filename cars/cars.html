  <h2>About</h2>
  <hr>
	The Commutative Algebra Reading Seminar (CARS) is an opportunity for graduate students at UNL to learn more about commutative algebra together.
	In contrast to <a href="https://eloisagrifo.github.io/UNLCAS/index.html">CAS</a>, this seminar is ran by graduate students, for graduate students.
	Each week a graduate student volunteers to give a talk.
	These talks often are on general background in commutative algebra, are about their current research, or cover research papers.
