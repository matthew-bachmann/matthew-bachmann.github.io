   I care deeply about my role as an instructor in the
   classroom. The common adage is that mathematics is not a spectator
   sport. Accepting this premise, the real work comes in answering the
   question: how do we foster genuine participation? I believe that in order for a student to participate they must first feel valued and respected. This is why my main goal in the classroom is to develop an environment that is welcoming and collaborative.
   A space where students feel comfortable with exploaration is a space where learning happens best.

   In these courses I focused on an active learning classroom
   structure. A usual class day comprised of students completing group work
   interspersed with short class discussions to introduce definitions
   or do examples. For many courses, worksheets had been developed by UNL to
   facilitate active learning, though these had not yet been developed
   for Math 203J, Math 107, or Math 104 (Summer 2019, Spring
   2020). For those semesters I produced my own daily worksheets to guide group
   discussions and scaffold the course content.

  <h3>Associate Convener</h3>

  For the Fall 2022 and Spring 2023 semester I have the opportunity to
  oversee the Calculus I recitation instructors. I asked to take on this role
  because I'm excited to provide mentorship to those new to
  teaching. Most recitation instructors are first year graduate
  students or undergraduates and so they have little to no
  experience teaching. The associate convener is responsible for
    running weekly meetings to discuss course logistics and provide
    advice on how to introduce topics. The associate convener also does teaching observations for those new to
    teaching. We then have a follow-up teaching conversation to discuss how the class is going.

  <h3>Course Work</h3>

  <ul style="margin-bottom:10px;">
    <li style="margin-bottom:10px;"> Math 996: Research on the
    Learning of Mathematics,
    <em> Spring 2021 </em>

    <li style="margin-bottom:10px;"> Math 896: Teaching and Learning
    Mathematics at the Post-Secondary Level,
    <em> Fall 2018, Spring 2019 </em>
    </li>
    </li></ul>
    <br>
    In Math 996 we explored various topics related to research and
    theories on student learning accross grade levels and content
    areas. Math 896 is a pedagogy course that all second year gratuate
    students take at UNL. It is meant to be an introduction to
    mathematics education.
