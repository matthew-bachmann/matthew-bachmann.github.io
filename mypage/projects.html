    <h3>Nueral Network</h3>
  <p> I'm currently teaching myself Python by trying to build a nueral network from scratch (I know there are libraries for this that are much more efficient than what I can write). I was inspired by watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfMk-kjRv4c&t=355s">Sebastian Lague's youtube video </a> where he builds a nueral network to classify hand drawn images. That channel is great and I highly recommend checking it out! While the video explains ML concepts in a very accessible way, it does leave out some of the coding details. My goal is to recreate this project in Python and find ways to reproduce the beautiful graphs produced in the video. Here I will catalogue my journey, all code can be found on GitHub.

    Day 1

<p>
    I'm very interested in data visualization though I've never used Python for anything, let alone the data science libraries. So I began by trying to make a graph. My goal was to produce a nice looking graph for a general quadratic $ax^2+bx+c$ using `MatPlotLib` and `Numpy`. The first challenge immediately presented itself; VSCode served me a `modulenotfounderror: no module named 'matplotlib'` which is apparently a common issue.
