			<h2> Project List </h2> <hr>
			This is a list of projects proposed by current graduate students. These are just ideas, but can provide some inspiration for what a project proposal should look like. If you are an undergraduate applying for the program, you may mention any of these projects in your application, propose your own project, or just mention which areas interest you.

			<h3> Discrete Math </h3> <hr>

				<ul>

				<li style="margin-bottom:10px;">(<b>Graph Theory</b>) A graph is a collection of vertices (thought of as points) with edges (thought of as lines) connecting them (not to be confused with graphs which define/are defined by a function as in calculus). This project will be focused on the basics of graph theory, as well as some potential applications. Book TBD (can be provided).
				</li>

				<li style="margin-bottom:10px;">(<b>Posets and Lattices</b>) A partially ordered set (poset) is a set P equipped with a rule to compare some (though not necessarily all) pairs of elements in P. Hence, two examples of posets are (i) the real numbers equipped with "less than or equal to" and (ii) the subsets of a set equipped with "is a subset of". We'll investigate the surprisingly rich combinatorial structure of posets, and study many specific examples---particularly lattices. Those wanting more of the feel of this topic can look at the first chapter of this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200425170234/http://jlmartin.faculty.ku.edu/~jlmartin/LectureNotes.pdf"> book</a> that we'll use.
</li>
		 <li style="margin-bottom:10px;">(<b>Game Theory</b>)
                                Game theory is the mathematical study of how "players," who we assume are rational decision-makers, make choices in different scenarios ("games"). The games studied in game theory include games you might play with your friends: chess, dots and boxes, go, nim, etc... but game theorists also study less playful "games" with significant applications in economics, political science, and other fields. We will explore the mathematics of both types of games, guided by the text "Game Theory: A Playful Introduction," by Matt DeVos and Deborah A. Kent (can be provided).

			<h3> Applied Math</h3> <hr>
			<ul>
			<li style="margin-bottom:10px;">(<b>Calculus of Variations</b>)
The Calculus of Variations is the study of minimizing functionals (functions of functions) given certain physical constraints. The history of this subject is rich, reaching back to the Bernoulli Brothers (Johann and Jakob, not Daniel), Euler, and Lagrange. A student working on this project would learn the basics of calculus of variations, as well as some applications to partial differential equations, minimization of surfaces, and classical dynamics. The text used will be "A First Course in the Calculus of Variations" by Mark Kot (the text will be provided). 
			</li>
<li style="margin-bottom:10px;">(<b>Mathematical Biology</b>)
In this project, we'd find a topic of interest from the book Essential Mathematical Biology by Nicholas Britton, and work through the details. This book is a great introduction to the many different aspects of mathematical biology, because it covers simple population models like the Leslie matrix and the Lotka-Volterra equations, but also infectious disease models, population genetics and evolution, and molecular biology.
</li>
<li style="margin-bottom:10px;">(<b>Functional Analysis</b>)
Did you like linear algebra, but always felt bored in finite-dimensional spaces like R^n? If you want more spice in your life, then infinite-dimensional Hilbert <s>spice</s> space might be the place for you. In this project, we will work through selected chapters in A Course in Functional Analysis by John B. Conway, and apply them to the concrete example of Fourier series, which are important in pure math, physics, engineering, etc.
</li>


</ul>

<h3> Topology</h3> <hr>
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom:10px;">(<b>Knot Theory</b>)
A knot is a simple, smooth closed curve in three-dimensional space. This project will cover the basics of using mathematical techniques to distinguish knots from each other (or whatever topics the student is most interested in). One semester of linear algebra is strongly recommended. The project will work out of the text "Knot Theory" by Charles Livingston (the book can be provided).
</li>
</ul>

<h3> Algebra</h3> <hr>
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom:10px;">(<b>Group Representations</b>)
One strategy to understand a group better is to represent its elements as matrices acting on a vector space.  This approach allows for essential properties of the group to be represented by computable numbers, called the characters of the group.  We'll go through the first five chapters of Serre's book on group representations, which will be provided.  Serre wrote these chapters for his wife, who was a chemist, so they are very accessible.  They cover the fundamentals of character tables and a number of examples.
</li>

<li style="margin-bottom:10px;">(<b>Lie Algebras</b>)
Lie groups and Algebras live in the intersection of topology, calculus, linear algebra, and group theory, and have important applications in both pure mathematics and physics.  We will primarily use a text which introduces Lie Algebras through the perspective of calculus and linear algebra and contains many tangible examples (Naive Lie Theory by Stillwell).  Time permitting, we will supplement this approach with a text that places greater emphasis on gaining an algebraic understanding of the manner that lie algebras act on vector spaces (Introduction to Lie Algebras by Erdmann and Wildon).
</li>

<li style="margin-bottom:10px;">(<b>Projective Geometry</b>)
The projective plane is a fundamental construct used in algebraic geometry. We can begin with how the projective space is constructed as the set of lines through the origin of affine space. Then we can move on to the duality between lines and points on the projective plane and then on to an application of this duality with the Sylvester-Gallai Theorem. We might cover more topics in algebraic geometry depending on the directions we end up going in
</li>

<li style="margin-bottom:10px;">(<b>Algebraic Geometry</b>)
Algebraic geometry is the study of sets of common solutions to several polynomial equations. These sets of common solutions, called algebraic varieties, have many interesting geometric properties. The goal of the project is to demonstrate some of the fundamental ideas of algebraic geometry primarily in the context of algebraic curves. We will be using the text Algebraic Geometry: A Problem Solving Approach by Belshoff et al.  It will be helpful to have taken calculus III. Having taken linear algebra or taking liner algebra concurrently is strongly recommended.

<h3> Miscellaneous</h3>
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom:10px;">(<b>History of Mathematics</b>) The prime number theorem is a number theory classic which approximates the number of primes less than a given positive integer n. In the 1940's Atle Selberg and Paul Erdös both came up with elementary proofs of this theorem (Elementary in the sense that they do not use complex analysis.) However, a work that supposedly started as joint ended in a bitter dispute and each mathematician published their results separately. In this project we will get familiar with the history of prime number theorem and look into the dispute between Erdös and Selberg. Sources for this include two biographical books on Paul Erdös as well as different online sources and interviews.
</li>

<li style="margin-bottom:10px;">(<b>Communicating Mathematics and Group Theory</b>)
Perhaps one of the most challenging tasks of a mathematician is communicating mathematics to the general public. In this project we will research effective ways of communicating mathematics with the goal of creating one or more hands on workshops that are accessible to anyone regardless of their mathematical background.
